# Directory Compressor

This is a **Windows Console** app which is used to *make Zip file* from a folder in file system.
This app is written in **Delphi** programming language and in **Delphi 7** IDE.
This app uses [Abbrevia](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tpabbrevia/) component for zipping.

This app works by two methods.
 - If you run console app with double click, app will zip the files in folder which is app's location folder.
 - If you run app by command prompt with a specific path, app will zip the files in folder which we gave as a parameter.

# Documentation and Screenshots

You can look up the source code's documentation in [Documentation](https://github.com/coderserdar/DirectoryCompressor/blob/main/Documentation/directoryCompressor.pdf) section. In this *PDF* file you can analyze source code. This PDF file supports Hyperlink, so you can go to a specific function easily. I try to write detailed comments in functions.
